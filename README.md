# Brisbane Amateur Radio Club

This is a web site for BARC.

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) for site generation and is hosted by GitHub.


# Theme Details

We are currently using the [minimal
mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) and this has some good
documentation on how to configure and customise.

We use:
* `pages` for main navigation items
* `posts` for aritcles, updates and things happening
* and various collections for other useful documents

# How to edit

This is a WIP. will be updated shortly

Once setup, you can run jekyl locally, serving the content as you edit by running the
`serve.sh` script in the root of this repo.
