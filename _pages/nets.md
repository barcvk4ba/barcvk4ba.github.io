Running Notes
listen for questions asked from individuals and remind them when you can

jump in and rehearse or reinstate the order of callers when needed

catch all late net callers and slot them in the end of the net over

remind callers keep a space between each other so the repeater resets when necessary

Have fun it's a learning experience that will be good for you
