**Congratulations on being a Net Controller**

Ensure you have a pen and paper for your log to write call order and other relevant information, have water, food or anything else you need to have during the entire net and don't forget to have fun.

1. Announce the beginning of the net is about to commence
2. Announce your name, call sign and that you are the net controller for this BARC net and doubts should be relayed back to you for comment and or remedy
3. Announce you are ready to receive callers and that they should state their call sign and name
4. Write in your log of all of the call signs until silence is heard
5. Then rehearse your list to the callers to affirm all callers and the net order
6. You can then ask for any more callers to identify before you start the net
7. Start the net with the first caller and proceed through the callers to the end of the first over
8. You can now pause to ask for any more callers
9. Add any callers to the list announcing it to the group
10. Continue on through the overs as above until the end of the net pausing at your over to request any more callers
11. Announce the final over and invite closing comments
12. Thank everyone for their participation and officially close the net to the group.


**Running Notes**
* Listen for specific questions asked from individuals and remind the group when you can.
* Jump in and rehearse or reinstate the order of callers when needed.
* Catch all late net callers and slot them at the end of the net over.
* Remind callers to keep a silent space between each other so the repeater resets when necessary.

Have fun it's a learning experience that will be good for you.
