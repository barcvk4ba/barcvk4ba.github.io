Club shack days at Rochedale are the second and fourth Saturday of every month. They are a great mix of social and amateur radio related discussion, starting at 12PM with a sausage sizzle.

We meet online every Thursday night at 8PM for tech talks and general amateur radio related discussion.
We also chat a bunch on the club Discord server in between meetings.

The club has a number of members that are very active in [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) (POTA) and [Summits on the Air](https://www.sota.org.uk/) (SOTA).  We are always keen to get anyone interested along on an activation to see what it's all about. The club also has a remote HF setup for members to use, for hunting POTA/SOTA activators, HF nets or just HF DX.
