# VK4RBA

Our Rochedale repeaters are operated by the Brisbane Amateur Radio Club and located at
the Rochedale Scout Hall in 20 Rochedale Road, Rochedale, servicing the Greater Brisbane area.

## DMR Repeater

Our repeater operates at the frequencies below:

* Output Frequency: 431.725 MHz
* Input Frequency: 438.725 MHz

## 70cm

Our repeater operates at the frequencies below:

* Output Frequency: 439.950 MHz
* Input Frequency: 434.950 MHz
* CTCSS tone of 91.5 is required to access the repeater.

## 2m


Our repeater operates at the frequencies below:

* Output Frequency: 147.925 MHz
* Input Frequency: 147.325 MHz
* CTCSS tone of 91.5 is required to access the repeater. 

## Parrot Repeater (recorder)

A parrot repeater 145.225MHz FM with 3 minute record time has been sent up at Rochedale.

You can use this repeater to test your radios on and compare the difference between them and/or understand how that radio sounds to other listeners.

Operational details - The parrot repeater utilises narrow deviation FM

* Most new transceivers are narrow band ( low deviation);
* If using with a wide band transmission, talk softly and it will be okay and 
* If you still have distortion you could adjust the deviation control on a wide band transmission until it sounds okay.

## WSPR Beacon

BARC has joined the International WSPR Beacon Project to establish the largest HF Beacon Network around the globe which is currently in progress

WSPR Beacon Transmitter has been installed at Rochedale Qld with LPFs for the 80,40,30,20,17,15,12 and 10m bands.

Why use a WSPR Beacon?
Behind the curtains the project is starting to discuss ways to analyze the data derived from all the global WSPR Beacons. Seems like we can get some big data analytics cracks aboard to correlate solar indices and Ionospheric Key figures with the beacon data with the help of machine learning algorithms. Eventually leading to better HF propagation forecasting.
