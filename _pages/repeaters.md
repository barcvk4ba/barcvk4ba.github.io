# VK4RBA

Our Rochedale repeaters are operated by the Brisbane Amateur Radio Club and located at
the Rochedale Scout Hall in 20 Rochedale Road, Rochedale, servicing the Greater Brisbane area.
Currently under construction will be our 70cm DMR repeater built for Qld


## 70cm

Our New 70cm repeater VK4RMC operates from Mt Cootha at the frequencies below. Andrew VK4QF has kindly donated the repeaters operational capabilities to BARC for club use.  Andrew will continue to maintain and service the repeater into the future.  

Who is Andrew you might ask?  Well he is the man behind many 2m and 70cm repeaters in Qld.  He designed and installed the 2m linked repeater system â€“ 6 by 2m repeaters at Springbrook, Cootha, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Bunya Mountains and Warwick.  These are all linked together and provide tremendous coverage over SE Qld

* Output Frequency: 439.975 MHz
* Input Frequency: 434.975 MHz (standard -5MHz offset)
* Mode: Frequency Modulation
* 91.5 CTCSS Tone

## 2m

Our 2 Metre Repeater operates at the frequencies below.

* Output Frequency: 147.925 MHz
* Input Frequency: 147.325 MHz
* No CTCSS tone is required to access the repeater at the test site.

## Parrot Repeater (recorder)

**Currently offline with some hardware issues and other band issues**

A parrot repeater 145.225MHz with 3 minute record time has been sent up at Rochedale early October 2017

You can use this repeater to test your radios on and compare the difference between them and/or understand how that radio sounds to other listeners

Operational details - The parrot repeater utilises narrow deviation FM

* Most new transceivers are narrow band ( low deviation)
* If using with a wide band transmission, talk softly and it will be okay.
* If you still have distortion you could adjust the deviation control on a wide band transmission until it sounds okay.

Remember it's your hobby so get active and turn your radio on
