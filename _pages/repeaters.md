## Parrot Repeater (recorder)

**Currently offline with some hardware issues and other band issues**

A parrot repeater 145.225MHz with 3 minute record time has been sent up at Rochedale early October 2017

You can use this repeater to test your radios on and compare the difference between them and/or understand how that radio sounds to other listeners

Operational details - The parrot repeater utilises narrow deviation FM

* Most new transceivers are narrow band ( low deviation)
* If using with a wide band transmission, talk softly and it will be okay.
* If you still have distortion you could adjust the deviation control on a wide band transmission until it sounds okay.
