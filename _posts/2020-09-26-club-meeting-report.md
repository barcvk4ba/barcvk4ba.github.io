We had a windy day but good to see all the members and two new ones who
attended as well around 18 bodies in all.

## Demonstration of "Allstar"

Glen VK4PK demonstrated another analogue digital hybrid radio that uses
the world wide PABX system to transfer signals around the globe - very
interesting.

Glen will share with members his interface/node in the future so you
will get to know how it works first hand Stand by for more news soon
and yes it will be on the next Zoom meeting agenda as there is much
to talk about

## Club Internet

The Internet connection, is a sticking point as to how we get it to
perform better for all the tasks and projects we want it to
discussed a few viable options for going forward and will keep you
posted on outcomes and ideas before we make the leap.

## DMR Repeater

The DMR repeater is getting its legs early with offers of assistance
with paired frequencies and repeater gear etc, and would be criminal
to deny it an early existence as we had gazetted it to next year,  Oh Dear.

## Shack Refurbish

We are starting to refurbish the shack with some improvement to the
tower mast end.

Bob VK4BXI has supplied the 70cm cavities for the 70cm repeater and
they do work we tested.

Very soon we will remove the desk and tool gear and place the book case
on the wall horizontally underneath that we will place a Ikea 8 cube unit
as storage and use it as a work bench top.

The new cavities will be installed beside the current server cabinet on
a shelving unit supplied by Ashley VH4ASH temporarily to get it working.
However it would be advantageous to have another server cabinet ready for
all our future projects which are multiplying.

We are looking for a new server rack to compliment our old one. Do you know
of any going to waste? It is a 19 in standard rack at full height. We would
like a free one :) or at least low cost.

## Repeaters I-Dents Confirmation

Leigh Hall VK4LAH confirms our old 70cm repeater does use an ident program
and it is transmitted in CW he knows this because he has heard it transmitted.

The 2M repeater has an I-Dent program and it is transmitted in voice. At this
time if there is an ongoing QSO, it will take precedence over the QSO or as
others have coined it, _stomp_ on their transmission.

It may be down to firmware as there is no menu item to change it will keep you
posted. PS has it worked previously by co-voicing on transmission in the recent past?

## Steppir Mast

Was too windy again to drop the mast but I got the wire pulley installed and
ready to use, now to get the other end up the tower mast ASAP.

## Storage Rooms

Clean up of storage rooms planned for late October and/or early Nov.
We will tackle the blue room storage room and remove everything to tables
to sort out what we really have.

We will endeavor to keep what we will use and dispose of firstly to members
and the remainder to junk to recyclers and  out of our hair.

It has been in their several years and needs going over for currency. If
possible I would like to complete both rooms on the same day which means we
have a lot of electronic and radio parts in the other shed to accommodate for
the future of the club so more talking before we get there for ideas to plan for it
and we should assign individuals to look after certain gear and parts.

Volunteers needed.
