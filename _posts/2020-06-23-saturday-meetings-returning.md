We are returning to our regular face-to-face meetings at the shack. The first
meeting will be 27th June at 1:00PM.

As Queensland's COVID-19 restrictions are eased, we have decided to start
meeting again. We will be looking to follow the Scouts lead on social
distancing rules.

Les, our president will take us through the requirements when we arrive. We
will also need to maintain attendance records to assist with contact tracing
for COVID-19.
