We have returned to our regular face-to-face meetings at the shack. The first
meeting was on 27th June at 1:00PM. 

As Queensland's COVID-19 restrictions are eased, we have decided to start
meeting again. We will be looking to follow the Scouts lead on social
distancing rules.

Les, our president will take us through the requirements when we arrive. We
will also need to maintain attendance records to assist with contact tracing
for COVID-19.

Wednesday 9th September  net will move to 2M for at least this week as we will probably have the diplexer out for testing this week
will give you an update on Thursday night net

The first edition how to for Dummies is available

As this is our first draft it will be edited and finalised and once that is done it will by published on BARC Website in pdf form

We have cleaned up the shack, rearranged the furniture and installed an additional server cabinet and house the 70cm repeater securely in

Our Monday night club DMR net was also a good one where we got to discuss other DMR activities with around 11 participants joining  in the Net

Saturday Meetings include current projects in progress and catching up with members and their radios
