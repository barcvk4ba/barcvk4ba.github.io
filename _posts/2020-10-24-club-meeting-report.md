We had quite a good attendance for the day (20) even though it rained
out the afternoon and the Scout Hall was being used. Yes we did survive
but it was dampish.

## Visitors

Ray Parrinder a long time member and steam engine punk head attended
today to say hello, He is now in a retirement home and away from his
beloved steam locos and radios so his daughters brought him to the club
for a visit and he wants to come back in a few weeks at our last
Saturday for the year.

Jim Kelly was there as well and good to see him again and hopefully
in the near future I will help him raise up a new antenna so he can
get on the regular club nets again

a quick overview of RASA and Amateur Radio.

## Other Items

We also discussed again the need to get internet into the shack asap, and
that is under way currently so expect some more news this week.

We have already requested a frequency pair for the new DMR repeater.
Glenn said it might be advantageous for us to suggest a pair that the
Allocation Officer can look at so if you have some suggestions please
forward to me ASAP.
